# NIST-Tests
The MATLAB implementation NIST tests for test of randomness

README


This TEST performs the 15 tests in matlab as given in NIST.
There arent 15 but 11 are complete.
I tried my best to make the code error free. Any sugesstion is welcomed.
These tests help in recognizing whether a certain number pattern is completely random or not.
Steps:

1.Include voltagelevvals.xlsx file in MATLAB
2.Select the entire column of the binary input.
3.Rename it as VOLTAGELEVVALS in Workspace.
4.Run the program.

Thank you.
